# Formula 1 Race Winner Predictor

---

## Project Overview
My project allows for people to predict the winner of an upcoming formula 1 race using a decision tree machine learning model. It relies on the data found in my CSV file to predict the winner of a race
based on factors such as past performances, the circuit chosen, etc.


## How to Run the Program
You can do wither one of the following:
1. Use the URl for the website and access the application from the website published on the streamlit cloud
2. You can download all of the files, then open the CMD, change the directory to where you have saved the main python file and then run the following command "streamlit run F1_Race_Preddiction_Final.py"
* (The above method is not reccommended as it is tedious and long, same results will be achieved using the URL)
